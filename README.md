# AVR Digital Clock

Make digital clock using atmel studio. As a fulfillment of Microprocessor System Task.

The challenge is by not using the library provided by arduino itself. To fulfill this challenge we must using and assing the pins of ATMEGA328p at the digital and analog inputs. Adjusting the algorithm of ISR (interrupt mode), limiter of clock, display mode using bits, and state of button setting. 

Tools:
* Arduino Nano
* 2 Seven segment 4 piece
* Transistors, Resistors, Capacitors
* 2 buttons
